# Embedded-Escape-Room-Station
### Embedded escape-room station using Arduino Nano RP2040 with sensor/actuator integration, C control logic, and basic AI-assisted interaction.

This project implements an interactive embedded systems station developed as part of a team-based escape room challenge. The system is built around an Arduino Nano RP2040 and integrates multiple sensors and actuators to create a state-driven user interaction.

The station combines embedded C development, hardware interfacing, and basic AI/computer vision concepts to authenticate user actions and control a multi-stage mechanical response. A structured state-machine design is used to manage sequential and concurrent behaviors, ensuring reliable real-time operation.

The project demonstrates practical experience in:

- Microcontroller programming using the Pico SDK (C)

- Sensor and actuator integration

- Driver-level hardware control

- State-flow modeling and system logic design

- Team-based embedded system development and debugging
